Sunlight dances through the canopy above your head, dappling the earth below your feet. Birds chirp quietly in the distance, hiding out of sight within the amongst the rustling leaves. Out of the corner of your eye you catch sight of a shadow darting past you.",

Glass litters the floor from the shattered windows, and the old, weathered walls are marred by deep claw marks.
